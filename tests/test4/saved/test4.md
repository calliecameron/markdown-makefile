# The Title {#__h1_1}

This is some text before a section. It shouldn’t be indented.

## This is a section {#__h2_1}

This is some test text. This is formatted in *italics* and **bold**, with - various – dashes—, and trailing dots…

This is a bullet list:

-   This is the first paragraph of the first item.

    And the second paragraph of the first item.

-   The second item only has one paragraph.

This is a numbered list:

1.  This is the first paragraph of the first item.

    And the second paragraph of the first item.

2.  The second item only has one paragraph.

And then there should be some text ^in superscript^ and ~in subscript~, and a footnote[^1] with a star, a footnote[^2] with a dagger, and this should be `monospace`.

### Subsection {#__h3_1}

> This is a quote block. It should be indented slightly and shouldn’t contain a line break.

> | “These literal double curly quotes, used where smart

> | ‘These literal single curly quotes, used where smart
> | quotes gets it wrong, curl the right way even though
> | they’re on different lines.’

After this line there should be stars.
