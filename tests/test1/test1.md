This is some text before a section. It shouldn't be indented.

# This is a section

This is some test text. This is formatted in *italics* and **bold**, with - various -- dashes---, and trailing dots...

'These quotes should be curly,' and "so should these." There should be a blank line before the next paragraph:

&nbsp;

And then there should be some text ^in\ superscript^ and ~in\ subscript~, and a footnote^[This is a footnote. It should appear at the bottom of the page.] with a star, a footnote^[Another footnote.] with a dagger, and this should be `monospace`.

> | \‘These literal single curly quotes, used where smart

After this line there should be stars.
