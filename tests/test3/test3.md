# This is a section

This is some test text. This is formatted in *italics* and **bold**, with - various -- dashes---, and trailing dots...

'These quotes should be curly,' and "so should these." There should be a blank line before the next paragraph:

&nbsp;

And then we do a simple include:

!include include1

Text after simple include.

## Subsection

This is a new paragraph. This text is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span>.

# This is a second section

And this is *even more italic text*.
