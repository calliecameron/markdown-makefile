This is some text before a section. It shouldn’t be indented. Each
section should start on a new page (but subsections shouldn’t).

# This is a section

This is some test text. This is formatted in *italics* and **bold**,
with - various – dashes—, and trailing dots…

‘These quotes should be curly,’ and “so should these.” There should be a
blank line before the next paragraph:

 

And then there should be some text ^in superscript^ and ~in subscript~,
and a footnote[^1] with a star, a footnote[^2] with a dagger, and this
should be `monospace`.

## Subsection

Test text test text test text.

> This is a quote block. It should be indented slightly and shouldn’t
> contain a line break.

> | This is a quoted line block. It should be indented slightly
> | and have a *line break* after ‘slightly’, and **formatting**.

> | “These literal double curly quotes, used where smart
> | quotes gets it wrong, curl the right way even though
> | they’re on different lines.”

> | ‘These literal single curly quotes, used where smart
> | quotes gets it wrong, curl the right way even though
> | they’re on different lines.’

After this line there should be stars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a new paragraph after the stars. This text is [Small
Caps]{.smallcaps}. Here is a pound sign (£), a euro sign (€), and three
letters with accents: ëóû.

# This is a second section

And this is *even more italic text*.

[^1]: This is a footnote. It should appear at the bottom of the page.

[^2]: Another footnote.
